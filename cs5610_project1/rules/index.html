      <h3>How to Play BattleShip</h3>
      <p>
        This game of guessing, strategy and logical thought dates back to before
        world war one and is known the world over for being a simple game that
        can be played with no more than a pencil and two pieces of paper. It is
        a two player game which has since been released by many board game
        manufacturers and its popularity can be seen through not only the
        intricate detail now put into physical and digital renditions of it, but
        now also in a Hollywood film based on the game.
      </p>
      <h3>Start/Preparation</h3>
      <p>
        Each game can vary in the number of ships employed but a common practice
        is to have 5 ships of differing size (2 to 5) squares. An aircraft
        carrier is 5 squares long, a battleship is 4 squares long, both a
        submarine and a destroyer are three squares long and a patrol boat is
        two squares long. Each player must secretly place their ships on a grid
        of ten columns by ten rows. These represent the location of the ships on
        a battlefield. Each player will also be in possession of a second grid
        of the same size. Where the first grid is their own ships, the second
        one (which is blank at the beginning of the game) is a mirror of their
        opponent’s battlefield.

      </div>
      <h3>In Play</h3>
      <p>
        Once it is determined who will go first, that person will pick a square
        at random, calling it by its reference of column reference, row number
        (C3 for example). This represents their firing a missile directly at
        that square. If the opposing player has any part of one of their ships
        positioned on this square they must call “hit” and mark on their
        battlefield (first grid) which part has been hit. Equally the attacking
        player will place an “X” on their blank grid (the mirror of their
        opponents field) to show a hit. In this instance the first player will
        now be allowed to make another guess. This continues until the attacking
        player misses. As soon as the attacking player misses, whether it is the
        first or fifth guess, the tables are turned and the second player may
        now start making guesses in exactly the same way.
      </p>
      <h3>Victory</h3>
      <p>
        The player who successfully locates all their opponent’s ships first by
        hitting each square they occupy is the winner as all ships have been
        destroyed.
      </p>
      <h3>Viriations</h3>
      <p>
        Because this game has been in existence for so long, there are many
        different interpretations that apply differing variations on rules,
        fleet size, game length etc. Popular examples of this can be seen on
        smart phone applications such as Naval Strike and Naval Combat.
      </p>
      <p>
        A popular variation known as the Salvo variation looks specifically at
        the number of shot guesses that can be made per move. In this version a
        player may take as many guesses as they have ships remaining. So each
        player starts the game with 5 guesses, each one representing a shot from
        each of their live ships. As the game goes on and fleet size is reduced
        through ships being destroyed, so too are the number of guesses per go
        reduced. Some versions of this approach will not allow an extra guess in
        the event of a direct hit.
